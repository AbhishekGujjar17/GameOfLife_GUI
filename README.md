# Java Game of Life Simulator

This is a Java program that simulates the Game of Life using random, penta-decathalon oscillator, and simkin gun glider configurations. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Conway that follows simple rules to simulate the growth and death of cells on a two-dimensional grid.
