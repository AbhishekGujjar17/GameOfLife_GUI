# Java Game of Life Simulator

This is a Java program that simulates the Game of Life using random, penta-decathalon oscillator, and simkin gun glider configurations. 

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Conway that follows simple rules to simulate the growth and death of cells on a two-dimensional grid.

# How to Use

Clone the repository using git clone

Navigate to the project directory

Compile the code using javac *.java

# Run the code:

java Life 50 40 R

In the line above, 50 represents the number of iterations, 40 represents the grid 
size, and R represents the pattern type.

for Penta-decathlon Oscillator pattern

java Life 50 40 P

for Simkin glider gun pattern

java Life 50 40 S

Don't forget, if you edit the code then recompile it before running.
